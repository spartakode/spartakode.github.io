			<h1>Welcome to Sparta Kode</h1>

			<p>Hi. My name is Adnan Issadeen and I'm a software engineer from Sri Lanka who wants to go beyond the norm and build amazing things. 
			I've just two years experience, where I consider only 6 months of it to have been real SE work and therefore, I have a lot of catching up to do.</p>
		
			<p>Starting with this year, I made, for the first time, a set of things I wanted to achieve. One of which, was actually setting up my own website. The real challenge was, to set up a website on my own unmanaged VPS. And it was just great to have gotten <a href="http://spartakode.com">Sparta Kode</a> up and running. I will be writing more about those in my coming posts. This blog is part of my goal list, where I wanted to have a static site (although, I did consider hosting it on my own server first).</p>
		
			<p>With that said, I think it's time to get coding again. One valuable lesson I learnt with my new job, was to deliver often in some form. As such I have a &quot;deliver something Friday&quot; policy. Whether it's a major bug fix, UX improvement or even a completely new software, I aim to deliver every Friday. I would like to put something like that into place here except I do not know if I can commit to it. I will see how it pans out though, so, in the mean time, await the programming posts.</p>
